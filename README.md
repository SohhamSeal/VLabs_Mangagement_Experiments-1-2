# VLabs: Management Labs - First Two Experiments

Welcome to the repository for the first two experiments of VLabs Management Labs, focusing on the Law of Demand and the Law of Supply. These simulations provide a graphical approach to understanding fundamental concepts in economics.

## Simulation Preview

- **Law of Demand:** [Simulation Link](https://solve-nitk.github.io/vlab-management-lab/exp-law-of-demand/simulation.html)
- **Law of Supply:** [Simulation Link](https://solve-nitk.github.io/vlab-management-lab/exp-law-of-supply/simulation.html)

## Code Path

The code for the experiments is organized as follows:

- **Law of Demand:** VLabs_Exp_1_2/graph-project/Experiments/law of demand/experiment/pages/
- **Law of Supply:** VLabs_Exp_1_2/graph-project/Experiments/law of supply/experiment/pages/

These experiments are part of a CSD Project for the Management Lab at the National Institute of Technology Karnataka (NITK).

## About Virtual Labs

This project is hosted by Virtual Labs, an initiative aimed at providing remote access to labs in various disciplines of science and engineering. [Virtual Labs](https://www.vlab.co.in/) is an innovative platform that allows students and teachers to access practical experiments online.

**Management Labs** is the first of its kind, initiated by NITK. It is a pioneering effort to bring interactive and virtual simulations to the field of management education.

## Simulations Hosting

The simulations are currently hosted on the [VLabs website](https://www.vlab.co.in/), offering an engaging and accessible way for learners to explore economic principles through interactive experiences.
